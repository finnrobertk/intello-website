summary: "From monolith to microservices and cloud, with measurable gains in delivery velocity and member experience."

## Problem
A large legacy monolith slowed delivery and made it difficult to adapt to new business and member needs. At the same time, SPK needed to prepare for a transition to the cloud.

## Solution
As part of SPK’s architecture group and developer in the team, I contributed to migrating the monolith into microservices with clear service boundaries, Kotlin + Spring Boot, and CI/CD.

I also joined the cloud team delivering a proof-of-concept app on GCP in only 2 days – with the requirement to integrate with on-premise internal systems.

In addition, I had lead responsibility for the complex domain of pension payments, developing solutions that provide members with a clear overview of past and future payments on their dashboard.
