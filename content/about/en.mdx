# About Intello

My name is **Finn-Robert Kristensen**, and I run **Intello Group AS**, an independent consultancy for software development and architecture.

With more than 20 years of experience in the IT industry, I have worked on everything from complex legacy monoliths to modern microservice architectures, cloud platforms, and AI-driven solutions.

I am passionate about creating **robust, scalable, and simple systems** that deliver real value – whether modernizing an existing codebase, building new cloud-native services, or exploring opportunities with generative AI.

## Recent highlights include
- Leading the modernization of pension solutions at the **Norwegian Public Service Pension Fund (SPK)** into microservices.
- Building a complete website and booking system for a beauty salon using **Next.js and Sanity**.
- Exploring **MVP solutions for automated test generation with AI**.

---

**My core values are clarity, precision, and collaboration.**
I enjoy working closely with clients to find the right solutions – and delivering with high quality.
