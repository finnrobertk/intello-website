# Intello — Independent Software Architecture & Engineering

Intello helps companies modernize, scale and deliver faster. I specialize in backend modernization (Kotlin/Spring Boot, microservices, event-driven systems), cloud-native architectures, and fast, accessible frontends.

## What I do

- **Architecture & modernization**: from monolith to modular/microservices, domain-driven design, event-first thinking
- **Backend engineering**: Kotlin, Spring Boot, Postgres, Kafka/RabbitMQ, observability
- **Cloud & DevOps**: IaC, CI/CD, containerization, performance and cost optimization
- **Frontend**: modern, accessible, fast interfaces with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

## About this site

This repository contains the Intello company website. It’s built for speed, accessibility, and content maintainability.

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Internationalization**: next-intl (Norwegian and English)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with a refined, premium visual system)
- **Content**: MDX (project write-ups and about pages)
- **SEO**: Structured data, Open Graph/Twitter tags, dynamic metadata per locale

## Highlights

- **Internationalization**: locale-aware routes under `app/[locale]/` with language-specific metadata
- **Performance-first**: static generation where possible, optimized font loading, lean JS
- **Accessibility & UX**: strong color contrast, keyboard focus states, semantic HTML
- **Resiliency**: lightweight health endpoint at `/health` for uptime checks

## Project structure

- `app/` — App Router, layouts and pages
  - `app/layout.tsx` — root layout (html/body, global styles and fonts)
  - `app/[locale]/` — locale-scoped routes and layout
  - `app/health/route.ts` — health check endpoint (returns "ok")
- `components/` — UI components (hero, MDX components, SEO, navigation, footer)
- `content/` — MDX content (`about/`, `projects/`)
- `messages/` — i18n message catalogs
- `lib/` — utilities (projects loading, helpers)

## Local development

Requires Node 18+.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Locale-prefixed routes live under `/nb` and `/en`.

### Build & preview

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Deployment

- Deploy on any platform that supports Next.js 15 (Vercel recommended)
- SSG is used for most pages; dynamic routes are server-rendered as needed
- A GitHub Action pings search engines on successful deployment to refresh the sitemap

## SEO & metadata

- Per-locale metadata via `generateMetadata` in `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`
- Open Graph and Twitter Card support (`/public/og.png`)
- `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` generated by Next.js
